A Control System For Logical Block Diagnosis With Data Loading

This paper describes a section of an integrated
diagnostic monitor system which facilitates 
the checking of sections of instructions or subroutines
anywhere in the object program.  A new method 
of specifying all diagnostic operations in a format similar
to a computer program makes the system convenient 
to use and relatively simple to understand.  The paper
also describes a number of other novel diagnostic 
features which can be included in the system.
