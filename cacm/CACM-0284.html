Manipulation of Algebraic Expressions

An algorithm for algebraically manipulating
expressions of the form SUM{CiPi, i=1,...,n}; has 
been developed in conjunction with the development of programs
for systems analysis problems.  This algorithm 
enablesus to derive over-all system transfer functions
from algebraically described block diagrams of 
any linear continuous multi-loop feedback system.  The
machine representation of the derived expression, 
is, by virtue of the algorithm, in a form which simplifies
the task of compiling.  The algorithm was 
developed for a particular purpose in connection with
system analysis studies.  However, its application 
as a mathematical device extends far beyond
the confines of the original problem.
