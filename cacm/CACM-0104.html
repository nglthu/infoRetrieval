Digital Simulation of Discrete Flow Systems*

The discrete flow systems discussed are characterized
by the movement of randomly arriving 
items along interacting channels.  Programing a digital
computer to simulate such systems utilizes some 
techniques not common in other approaches to physical
problems.  The principal portion of the paper is 
a discussion of two simulation studies that illustrate
some of the programming problems involved. One 
is of an extensive package-handling plant, with the
objective being optimization of parameters such as 
storage capacities and processing rates.  In the other,
air traffic flow and control procedures are simulated 
to compare the effects of alternative control decisions.
