Further Remarks on Line Segment Curve-Fitting Using Dynamic Programming

In a recent paper, Bellman showed how dynamic
programming could be used to determine the solution 
to a problem previously considered by Stone.  The problem
comprises the determination, given N, of the 
N points of subdivision of a given interval (a,B) and
the corresponding line segments, that give the 
best least squares fit to a function g(x) in the interval.
 Bellman confined himself primarily to the 
analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however,
how the solution of the equation derived for each 
particular point of subdivision u(i) could be reduced to
a discrete search.  In this paper, the computational 
procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities
to some of Stone's equations are indicated. 
 It is further shown that an equation for u(i) involving
no minimization may be found.  In addition, 
it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the
curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints 
are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve.
