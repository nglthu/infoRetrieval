Topological Sorting of Large Networks

Topological Sorting is a procedure required
for many problems involving analysis of networks. 
 An example of one such problem is PERT.  The present
paper presents a very general method for obtaining 
topological order.  It permits treatment of larger networks
than can be handled on present procedures 
and achieves this with greater efficiency.  Although
the procedure can be adapted to any machine, it 
is discussed in terms of the 7090.  A PERT network of
30,000 activities can be ordered in less than one 
hour of machine time.  The method was developed as
a byproduct of procedures needed by Westinghouse, 
Baltimore.  It has not been programmed and at present
there are no plans to implement it.  In regard 
to the techniques described, Westinghouse's present
and anticipated needs are completely served by the 
Lockheed program, which is in current use.
